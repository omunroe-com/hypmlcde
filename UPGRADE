============================
HYPERMAIL VERSION 2.3.1:
============================
The configuration directive "htmlmessage_deleted" has been
renamed to "htmlmessage_deleted_spam". 

The configuration directive "deleted" has been deprecated in favor of
"annotated". However, to keep backwards compatibility with legacy
archives, it will still be honored; you don't have to update your
legacy archives.

=====================================
HYPERMAIL VERSION 2.x.x Upgrade Notes
=====================================
!!!!WARNING!!!!

Hypermail 2.x HTML output files, indexes, etc are not compatible with
1.x files.  When installing 2.x, all existing HTML files in the
specified output directory must be removed first.

Use the original 1.x mailbox files to regenerate the new 2.x archive.
If the mailboxes are not available it should be possible to use the
script hypetombox.pl in the contrib/ directory.
